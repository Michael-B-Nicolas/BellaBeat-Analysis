#BellaBeat Analysis Project

The BellaBeat Analysis project focuses on extracting insights from Fitbit data.
The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of user activity and health metrics captured by Fitbit devices.

Project Overview The project encompassed the following key steps:

Data Cleaning: I performed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality and consistency of the data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within the data. Data Visualization: I created visually appealing and informative charts, graphs, and plots to present the findings.

Project Structure The project repository is structured as follows:

data: This folder contains the Fitbit data files used in the analysis. scripts: This folder contains the SQL scripts used for querying and extracting data from Microsoft SQL Server. notebooks: This folder contains the R notebooks used for data cleaning, EDA, and visualization. visualizations: This folder contains the visualizations generated during the analysis.

Technologies and Tools Used The BellaBeat Analysis project was implemented using the following technologies and tools:

Microsoft SQL Server: Used for querying and extracting Fitbit data from the Fitbase database. R: Utilized for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. R Packages: Various R packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr were employed for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Google Sheets: Utilized as an intermediate step to download the tables created from the queries executed in Microsoft SQL Server before proceeding with the data analysis and visualization in R.

Results and Findings The BellaBeat Analysis project yielded several significant insights, including:

Daily activity patterns and trends. Correlations among different health metrics. Peak activity hours and sleep patterns. Activity level comparisons across different user segments. Recommendations for enhancing user engagement and product features. For a more detailed exploration of the findings and to view the visualizations, please refer to the project notebooks and visualizations folder.
